  // Immediately close the notification after it's clicked to keep the notification tray clean.

// --- PWA Installability: Minimal Fetch Handler ---
// THIS IS CRUCIAL for PWA installability!
// A service worker *must* have an 'fetch' event listener to be recognized as
// a Progressive Web App capable of offline functionality (even if it does nothing).
// Its mere presence satisfies a key PWA criterion for showing the "Add to Home Screen" prompt.
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  // In this minimal implementation, we simply let all network requests
  // pass through to the network as they normally would.
  // This means the service worker is not actively caching or intercepting
  // network requests, but its presence signals PWA capabilities to the browser.
  // For more advanced offline capabilities or caching strategies, you would
  // add specific logic here using the Cache API.
