// ADDED: Minimal fetch handler for PWA installability
// This is crucial! A service worker must have a 'fetch' event listener
// to fulfill PWA installability criteria, even if it doesn't perform
// any complex caching or network interception. Its presence tells the
// browser that the service worker is capable of intercepting requests.
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  // For this application, we're letting all network requests
  // pass through to the network as usual.
  // This approach is safe and simply ensures the PWA installability flag is met.
